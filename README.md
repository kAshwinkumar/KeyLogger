# KeyLogger Project
Simple Keylogger: Capturing and Logging Keystrokes Using Python

## Description
This project implements a basic keylogger using Python's `pynput` library. The keylogger captures and logs every keystroke made by the user to a file named `log.txt`. It identifies special keys (such as space, enter, shift, etc.) and logs them in a readable format.

## Features
- Captures and logs all keystrokes.
- Identifies and logs special keys in a human-readable format.
- Stores logged keystrokes in a text file (`log.txt`).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.12.3
- `pynput` library

You can install the `pynput` library using pip:
```bash
pip install pynput 
```

# Usage
- Clone or download the project to your local machine.
- Ensure that Python and the pynput library are installed.
- Run the main_key.py script:
```bash
python main_key.py
```
- The script will start logging keystrokes. Press keys on your keyboard, and they will be recorded in the 'log.txt' file.

### Important Notes
